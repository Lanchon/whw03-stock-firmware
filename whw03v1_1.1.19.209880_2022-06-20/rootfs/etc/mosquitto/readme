Introduction
============

  This directory contains alternate versions of the ACL file for the
  default port (1883).  This port is unencrypted and require no login.
  It provides backward compatibility to devices running older firmware
  that have not implemented secure connections.

  Each file restricts publishing and/or subscribing to various topics.


open.acl
========

  No restrictions whatsoever; equivalent to having no ACL file at all.
  This is identical to a Master running pre-security firmware.


moderate.acl
============

  Most status messages are permitted along with those needed for setup
  and firmware updates.  More dangerous command messages (e.g. Node
  steering) are not allowed.


strict.acl
==========

  Only the bare minimum of messages needed for setup and firmware
  update.  The Node may not be present in `bh_report' or other status
  APIs.
